 CereVoice Engine SDK Quick Start

================================================================================

This is the quick start guide for the Engine SDK, see the
'CereVoiceSdkGuide.pdf' file for more extensive documentation.

 Prerequisites
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First, ensure that at least one voice file (eg
'cerevoice_heather_5.0.0_48k.voice') has been downloaded, and that the
license key for the voice has been saved to a file.

If you do not have access to a voice or a license key, please use the
support request link below to contact CereProc:

 Generating TTS Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To quickly generate some synthetic speech, use the applications in the
'examples/basictts' directory.

Synthesise an XML file with 'basictts', output audio is played:
basictts speaker.voice license.lic myinput.xml

Synthesise an XML file with 'basictts', output audio is saved to disk:
basictts speaker.voice -o myoutput.wav license.lic myinput.xml

If the audio playback libraries are not available, use the 'txt2wav'
example application:
txt2wav speaker.voice license.lic myinput.xml myoutput.xml

 Low Latency TTS Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The 'tts_callback' program processes input files incrementally, and
outputs audio one phrase at a time.  This allows for low latency
processing of large documents.

Synthesise with audio playback, playback begins before the large
document is fully processed:
tts_callback speaker.voice license.lic largefile.xml

 Python Examples
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Python examples can be found in 'examples/python', ensure that the
'cerevoice_eng/pylib' directory is on the Python path.  For audio
playback with 'tts_callback.py', ensure that the path also contains
'cerevoice_aud/pylib'.

 React Native Example Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run the TtsExample app, make sure the licence and voice files are
placed in 'android/app/src/main/assets/' and 'ios/'. Also for ios these
files and 'app.config.json' should be copied as bundle resources. Make
sure your 'app.config.json' files has licence and voice file names. The
'app.config.json' files can be found in main directory and in android
assets directory.

The application uses 'react-native-cerevoice-eng' module for synthesis.
It also uses 'react-native-cerevoice-play' module for playing the
synthesised output. This module is not tested and only acts as an
example. It is highly recommended to not use this module.

To use 'react-native-cerevoice-eng' module in your application copy 
the built files from 'cerevoice_eng/rnlib' to 'react-native-cerevoice-eng'
directory in your desired path. Before installing add 
'"react-native-cerevoice-eng": "file:/path/to/react-native-cerevoice-eng"'
to your package.json file. Then run
'npm install react-native-cerevoice-eng; react-native link react-native-cerevoice-eng'
to install and link the module.

================================================================================

 Application Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All of the example applications are supplied with C source code in the
files 'basictts.c', 'txt2wav.c' and 'tts_callback.c'.  This code can
be used as the basis of an application integration.

The example application makefiles ('Makefile.cygwin', Makefile.linux'
and 'Makefile.osx') can be used to build the applications, and as a
reference for the required library dependencies.  The 'LIBS' variable
contains TTS library dependencies. The 'AUDIOLIBS' variable contains
the audio playback dependencies.  Some applications will not need to
use the audio library functionality.

Full documentation for the 'cerevoice_eng.h' and
'cerevoice_eng_simp.h' header files can be found by loading:
docs/cerevoice_eng/index.html

Full documentation for the 'cerevoice_aud.h' header file can be found
by loading:
docs/cerevoice_aud/index.html

The LICENSE_3RDPARTY information must be supplied with any
applications based on this SDK.
