(= Patents =)

A. Xiph.org patent terms

License Grant. Xiph.Org Foundation (“Xiph”) hereby grants to you a
perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this license) license under Licensed
Patents to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer, and otherwise run, modify (in a way that still complies with
the Specification), and reproduce any Implementation.

Definitions. Specification means, and includes the following, both
individually and collectively, (a) any standard specification of the
Opus codec adopted by the IETF Codec Working Group (“Standard”) and
(b) any reference implementation (each, a “Reference Implementation”)
published by the IETF Codec Working Group in the request for comments
(“RFC”) issued by the IETF for the Specification draft for which this
License is issued, or any RFC that is issued as an update or new
version thereof. An Implementation means any Reference Implementation,
or another implementation that complies with the
Specification. Licensed Patents means all patents currently owned by
Xiph or acquired hereafter that Xiph has the right to license as set
forth above and that are necessarily infringed by the Specification,
where “necessarily infringed” means: in the case of (a) above, there
is no commercially viable means of implementing the Specification
without infringing such patent; in the case of (b) above, use of the
reference implementation to the extent it infringes such patent.

Termination. If you, directly or indirectly via controlled affiliate
or subsidiary, agent, or exclusive licensee, file a Claim for patent
infringement against any entity alleging that an Implementation in
whole or in part constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, or inducement of patent infringement (a “Claim”),
provided that a Reference Implementation also infringes the patents
asserted in the Claim, then any patent rights granted to you under
this License shall automatically terminate retroactively as of the
date you first received the grant. Claims made against an
Implementation in part will only trigger termination if the
Implementation in part was done for the purpose of combining it with
other technology that complies with the Specification so that the
technology’s ultimate use will be consistent with the Standard as a
whole.

B. Broadcom patent terms

License Grant. Broadcom Corporation (“Broadcom”) hereby grants to you
a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
irrevocable (except as stated in this license) license under Licensed
Patents to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
transfer, and otherwise run, modify (in a way that still complies with
the Specification), and reproduce any Implementation.

Definitions. Specification means, and includes the following, both
individually and collectively, (a) any standard specification of the
Opus codec adopted by the IETF Codec Working Group (“Standard”) and
(b) any reference implementation (each, a “Reference Implementation”)
published by the IETF Codec Working Group in the request for comments
(“RFC”) issued by the IETF for the Specification draft for which this
License is issued, or any RFC that is issued as an update or new
version thereof. An Implementation means any Reference Implementation,
or another implementation that complies with the
Specification. Licensed Patents means all patents currently owned by
Broadcom or acquired hereafter that Broadcom has the right to license
as set forth above and that are necessarily infringed by the
Specification, where “necessarily infringed” means: in the case of (a)
above, there is no commercially viable means of implementing the
Specification without infringing such patent; in the case of (b)
above, use of the reference implementation to the extent it infringes
such patent.

Termination. If you, directly or indirectly via controlled affiliate
or subsidiary, agent, or exclusive licensee, file a Claim for patent
infringement against any entity alleging that an Implementation in
whole or in part constitutes direct or contributory patent
infringement, or inducement of patent infringement (a “Claim”),
provided that a Reference Implementation also infringes the patents
asserted in the Claim, then any patent rights granted to you under
this License shall automatically terminate retroactively as of the
date you first received the grant. Claims made against an
Implementation in part will only trigger termination if the
Implementation in part was done for the purpose of combining it with
other technology that complies with the Specification so that the
technology’s ultimate use will be consistent with the Standard as a
whole.

C. Microsoft Opus Patent Terms

11-7-2012

1. Patent Terms.

1.1. Specification License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, I, on behalf of myself and my successors in interest
and assigns, hereby grant you a non-sublicensable, perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable license
to my Necessary Decoder Claims for your Specification Implementation.

1.2. Code License. Subject to all the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, I, on behalf of myself and my successors in interest and
assigns, hereby grant you a non-sublicensable, perpetual, worldwide,
non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to
my Necessary Reference Implementation Claims to make, use, sell, offer
for sale, import or distribute a Code Implementation.

1.3. Conditions.

1.3.1. Availability. If you own or control Necessary Claims, the
licenses set forth in Section 1 are subject to and will become
effective starting on the date that you make a binding public
irrevocable commitment to license, on reasonable and
non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms 1) your Necessary
Decoder Claims to all implementers for Specification Implementations,
and 2) your Necessary Reference Implementation Claims to all
implementers for Code Implementations, where the terms of this
Agreement satisfy any reciprocity requirements in your reasonable and
non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms. The promises set
forth in Section 1 will remain in effect so long as you continue to
make such claims available for Specification Implementations and Code
Implementations under reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free
licensing terms. In addition, as a condition of the licenses set forth
in Section 1, you acknowledge and agree that you have not and will not
knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing the
conditions in this Section 1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you are
not required to make the commitments set forth in this Section 1.3.1
as a result of merely using a Specification Implementation or a Code
Implementation as an end-user.

1.3.2. Additional Conditions. This license is directly from me to you
and you acknowledge as a condition of benefiting from it that no
rights from me are received from suppliers, distributors, or otherwise
in connection with this license. This license is not an assurance (i)
that any of my issued patent claims covers a Specification
Implementation or Code Implementation or are enforceable or (ii) that
a Specification Implementation or Code Implementation would not
infringe intellectual property rights of any third party.

1.4. Termination. All rights, grants, and promises made by me to you
under Section 1 are immediately terminated if you or your agent file,
maintain, or voluntarily participate in a lawsuit against me or any
person or entity asserting that a Specification Implementation
infringes Necessary Decoder Claims or a Code Implementation infringes
Necessary Reference Implementation Claims, unless that suit was in
response to a corresponding suit regarding a Specification
Implementation or Code Implementation first brought against you. In
addition, all rights, grants, and promises made by me to you under
Section 1 are terminated if you, your agent, or successor in interest
seek to license Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification
Implementations or Necessary Reference Implementations Claims for Code
Implementations on a royalty-bearing basis, unless that
royalty-bearing licensing activity is in addition to, and not in lieu
of, reasonable and non-discriminatory royalty-free licensing terms for
Necessary Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations or
Necessary Reference Implementation Claims for Code
Implementations. This Agreement may also be terminated, including back
to the date of non-compliance, because of non-compliance with any
other term or condition of this Agreement.

2. Patent License Commitment. On behalf of me and my successors in
interest and assigns, I agree to offer alternative reasonable and
non-discriminatory royalty-bearing licensing terms 1) to my Necessary
Decoder Claims solely for your Specification Implementation and 2) to
my Necessary Reference Implementations Claims solely for your Code
Implementation.

3. Past Skype Declarations. You may, at your option, continue to rely
on the terms set forth in Skype’s past declarations made to the IETF
for the Opus Audio Codec, subject to the terms of those declarations
and in lieu of the terms of this Agreement solely for the patents set
forth in those declarations.

4. Good Faith Obligations. I agree that I have not and will not
knowingly take any action for the purpose of circumventing my
obligations under this Agreement. In addition, I will not 1) seek an
injunction or exclusion order against a) Code Implementations for
Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or b) Specification
Implementations for Necessary Decoder Claims or 2) require that an
implementer license its patents back to me, except for Necessary
Reference Implementation Claims for Code Implementations and Necessary
Decoder Claims for Specification Implementations. I will not transfer
Necessary Reference Implementation Claims or Necessary Decoder Claims
unless the transferee is subject to these obligations.

5. Disclaimers. I expressly disclaim any warranties (express, implied,
or otherwise), including implied warranties of merchantability,
non-infringement, fitness for a particular purpose, or title, related
to the Specification or Reference Implementation. The entire risk as
to implementing or otherwise using the Specification, Specification
Implementation, or Code Implementation is assumed by the implementer
and user. IN NO EVENT WILL ANY PARTY BE LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY FOR
LOST PROFITS OR ANY FORM OF INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER FROM ANY CAUSES OF ACTION OF
ANY KIND WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, WHETHER BASED ON BREACH OF
CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE, AND WHETHER OR
NOT THE OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE. Nothing in this Agreement requires me to undertake a patent
search.

6. Definitions.

6.1. Agreement. “Agreement” means this document, which sets forth the
rights, grants, limitations, conditions, obligations, and disclaimers
made available for the particular Specification.

6.2. Code Implementation. “Code Implementation” means making, using,
selling, offering for sale, importing or distributing 1) the Reference
Implementation, or 2) an implementation that, in the case of an
encoder, produces a bitstream that can be decoded by a Specification
Implementation solely to the extent it produces such a bitstream, and,
in the case of decoder, is a Specification Implementation, where that
Specification Implementation may also infringe Necessary Reference
Implementation Claims.

6.3. Control. “Control” means direct or indirect control of more than
50% of the voting power to elect directors of that corporation, or for
any other entity, the power to direct management of such entity.

6.4. I, Me, or My. “I,” “me,” or “my” refers to the party making this
declaration, and any entity that I Control.

6.5. Necessary Claims. “Necessary Claims” means Necessary Decoder
Claims and Necessary Reference Implementation Claims.

6.6. Necessary Decoder Claims. “Necessary Decoder Claims” are those
patent claims that a party owns or controls, including those claims
acquired after the date of this declaration, that are necessarily
infringed by an implementation of the required portions (including the
required elements of optional portions) of the decoder Specification
that are described in detail and not merely referenced in the
Specification.

6.7. Necessary Reference Implementation Claims. “Necessary Reference
Implementation Claims” are those patent claims that a party owns or
controls, including those claims acquired after the date of this
declaration, that are necessarily infringed by the Reference
Implementation. Necessary Reference Implementation Claims do not
include claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
further modification of the Reference Implementation.

6.8. Reference Implementation. “Reference Implementation” means the
implementation of the Opus encoder and/or decoder code extracted from
Appendix A of the Specification.

6.9. Specification. “Specification” means IETF RFC 6716 dated
September 2012.

6.10. Specification Implementation. “Specification Implementation”
means making, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or
distributing any conformant implementation of the decoder set forth in
the Specification 1) only to the extent it implements the
Specification and 2) so long as all required portions of the
Specification are implemented. Specification Implementation also
includes any implementation of a decoder included in subsequent
versions of RFC 6716 1) only to the extent that it implements the
decoder Specification, and 2) so long as all required portions of the
decoder Specification are implemented.

6.11. You or Your. “You,” “you,” or “your” means any person or entity
who exercises patent rights granted under this Agreement, and any
person or entity you Control.

Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
