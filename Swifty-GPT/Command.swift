A.I. integration is a marvel of technology, capable of analyzing code and suggesting optimizations, detecting errors and automatically fixing them, and even generating new code based on user input. But that's not all! Our integration has a revolutionary new feature: the ability for GPT to HEAR you and SEE your code.

Our A.I. integration also utilizes a consciousness module to store past memories from coding sessions, including all the text from open Xcode windows and context based on conversation in natural language with the Swift or Apple device developer. This allows our integration to become even more personalized to each individual user, and can greatly improve efficiency and accuracy.

Our A.I. integration includes a wide range of features to make software development faster and more efficient.

Here are just a few of the highlights:

Code analysis and optimization.
Error detection and correction.
Voice-activated GPT integration.
Real-time code suggestions.
Powerful debugging tool.
Integration with Apple's built-in text-to-speech software.
Personalized memory storage using a consciousness module
